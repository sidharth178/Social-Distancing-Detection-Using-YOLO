 ## üìå**Objective**
To ensure social distancing protocol in public places and workplace, i've developed a social distancing detection tool that can monitor if people are keeping a safe distance from each other or not by analyzing real time video streams from the camera.

## üîë**Prerequisites**
All the required libraries are included in the file <code>requirements.txt</code>

## ‚ö†Ô∏è**TechStack/framework used**
- Deep Learning
- Image Processing
- OpenCV
- YOLOv3


## üöÄ**Installation**
Step-1: Clone this repository
